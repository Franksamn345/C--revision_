# The header of the programm file should have ".c" to show that we are working with c programming language
## The header that contains the functions to be used in the code ".h" shows that it is a header...example - #include <stdio.h>
* <stdio.h> stands for standard input and output
* "file.h" this is a user header. Note that it should contain a double quote to show that it is a user header file.
### Indentation:
* In every programmig language the programmer should indent the code.
* In c we indent using the carli brackets {} 
#### The "int main()"... 
* the main function should be there in every c code as it holds the code in which the computer understands
##### Data types are used to assign the variables to a specific type for memory storage
* eg "int, char, float."
* Anytime u are declaring a variable u should assin a type to show the type of data to be expected.
* A semicolon is used to end a line, but not used on a function declaration ";"
##### Variable initialization
* eg ..."int samn;" this is variable declaration
* eg ..."samn = 12;" the variable **samn** has been innitialized to value "12"
* The "\n" means that the compiler should print a new line at the end of the code
###### To print the value to the output screen
* We use the "printf()" function to print the values inputed to the output screen
